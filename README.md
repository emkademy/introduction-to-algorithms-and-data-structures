# Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

![Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures](introduction-to-algorithms-and-data-structures.jpeg)

## What this course is about?
In this course, we will talk about Algorithms & Data Structures. The lectures will be aided with animations for better understanding and many practice problems.
The goal is to make you very comfortable using different Algorithms & Data Structures and to build a solid background for **coding interviews**. 

## What are the prerequisites for taking this course?
* Knowing **a** programming language
* Patience & motivation

## Who is the course for?
* People with some programming knowledge, but not necessarily familiarity with different Algorithms and Data Structures
* People who are preparing for coding interviews
